    "# Temperature modeling for floating PV\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the PVSyst temperature model to calculate\n",
    "cell temperature for floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary benefits attributed to FPV systems is the potential\n",
    "for lower operating temperatures, which are expected to increase the\n",
    "operating efficiency. In general, the temperature at which a photovoltaic\n",
    "module operates is influenced by various factors including solar radiation,\n",
    "ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, and the characteristics of the\n",
    "cell and module materials, as well as the mounting structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular model for calculating PV cell temperature is the\n",
    "empirical heat loss factor model suggested by Faiman\n",
    "(:py:func:`pvlib.temperature.faiman`). A modified version of this model is\n",
    "has been proposed by PVSyst (:py:func:`~pvlib.temperature.pvsyst_cell`).\n",
    "The PVSyst model for cell temperature $T_{C}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}T_{C} = T_{a} + \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot E \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{m})}{U_{c} + U_{v} \\cdot WS},\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E$ is the plane-of-array irradiance, $T_{a}$ is the\n",
    "ambient air temperature, $WS$ is the wind speed, $\\alpha$ is the\n",
    "absorbed fraction of the incident irradiance, $\\eta_{m}$ is the\n",
    "electrical efficiency of the module, $U_{c}$ is the wind-independent heat\n",
    "loss coefficient, and $U_{v}$ is the wind-dependent heat loss coefficient.\n",
    "It should be noted that in many cases, similar to land-based PV systems,\n",
    "the wind-dependent heat loss coefficient ($U_{v}$) can be set to zero,\n",
    "and the denominator is thus reduced to a single combined U-value\n",
    "($U_{c}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the default heat loss coefficient values of the PVSyst model were\n",
    "specified for land-based PV systems and are not necessarily representative\n",
    "of FPV systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For FPV systems, the module's operating temperature, much like in land-based\n",
    "systems, is mainly influenced by the mounting structure (which significantly\n",
    "affects both U-value coefficients), wind, and air temperature. Thus, factors\n",
    "that help reduce operating temperatures in such systems include lower air\n",
    "temperatures and changes in air flow beneath the modules (wind/convection).\n",
    "In some designs, where the modules are in direct thermal contact with water,\n",
    "cooling effectiveness is largely dictated by the water temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems with closely packed modules and restricted airflow behind the modules\n",
    "generally exhibit lower heat loss coefficients compared to those with better\n",
    "airflow behind the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below gives heat loss coefficients derived for different FPV systems\n",
    "and locations as found in the literature. It should be noted that, for some\n",
    "systems, there are two sets of coefficients, where the second set uses only\n",
    "one heat loss coefficient (i.e., only $U_{c}$).\n",
